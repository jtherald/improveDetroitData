It gets me really upset. I want something to be done about this. I am going to give you a real life example about this. At this exact intersection my son’s dad collided into another car for the exact same reason. He was on John kronk and the light was green for him and on Lonyo a car ran a red light & that’s when my son’s father T-boned him.

I'm using this venue to notify the mayor and city council's offices because I was referred to them by the Detroit Parking Department and also because there is no category to choose here, and the phone option's voicemail box is full.  Typically, when the gate is up and there is no attendant, parking at a parking structure is free at that time.  How are customers supposed to know they have to pay at a structure under these circumstances?  Instructions on signs instructing how to pay do not notify me I have to pay since the gate that typically won't let vehicles pass is up. I have used this structure in the past and couldn't get in or out until I paid with a credit card.  I feel like I'm being set up to pay an extra $20 fee.  Have many others been lured into this trap? I found out after this happened to me a family member of mine got the same notice after parking there one month previous.  I have been offered 50% off the fine and still charged a processing fee. I feel I shouldn't be charged at all considering the gate being up lured me into parking there. If I am to pay anything it should only be the fare of $25 only. These are the outcomes I am expecting: Free or the fare of $25 at the most; Prosecution if any laws have been broken.

17365039,Archived,"This morning while waking my dog, I witnessed a civilian driving on the wrong side of the road, as he was turning left on Jefferson, from the corner of Atwater. Immediately following this event, as I walked home, towards the Riverfront Towers, coming from the corner of Jefferson and Atwater, I also witnessed an off-duty police officer in his own POV, speeding down Jefferson at about 65 miles an hour. About two minutes later, while still waking my dog down Jefferson, and back home to the Riverfront Towers, I also witnessed a woman in a sports car completely ignore two elderly bicyclists trying to cross Jefferson right in front of the JLA parking garage.  While driving straight towards the pedestrians at about 50 MPH, she whipped her vehicle very aggressively around the pedestrians, and gave them barely enough room to cross in front of her vehicle. t's important to note that the speed limit is only 25 MPH from the corner of Atwater and Jefferson, and all the way down to Rosa Parks, where the brand new park is being built. PLEASE heavily patrol Jefferson Ave, from Atwater St. all the way down to Rosa Parks Blvd. There are countless pedestrians, construction workers, wildlife, parked vehicles, two major construction sites, college kids, post office workers, elderly people, children, and people on scooters. Not to mention a freeway off ramp from the lodge where people take the exit down Jefferson and continue to drive as if they're on the highway. This entire area is completely undermanned, and should be one of the highest priorities of the police; speed bumps, radar screens, and a physical presence of multiple patrolman should be all over this area, until people realize it is not safe to drive over 25 miles an hour, in a heavily trafficked/pedestrian zone.",42.32568393374362,-83.05272728204727,1724603588000,,1724771040000,"https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/17365039",22880,"Traffic Complaints",3142339

The photo attached shows how much the car had to be cut away to get the driver out. It's a miracle he didn't end up entirely inside the home, but he did cause extensive damage. Who knows how long it'll take to repair the damage done to the house? I know for a fact that neighbors have been complaining about speeding for a long time, and that there have been multiple accidents along the stretch mentioned, including another driver going through a neighbors fence at Seminole and Vernor - and I'm just talking about the past 6-9 months.

17760022,Archived,"I am writing to formally lodge a complaint regarding the increasing presence of unlicensed taxis operating in Detroit during major events. I recently witnessed and experienced several troubling incidents involving these taxis, and I am deeply concerned for the safety and well-being of tourists and local residents.These taxis exhibit the following issues:• No Valid Taxi License: They do not possess the proper licenses required for operating commercial taxi services.• Lack of Commercial Insurance: There is no evidence of commercial insurance coverage, putting passengers at significant risk in the event of an accident.• No Valid Transportation Base: These taxis seem to operate independently and without a designated transportation base or company, raising further safety and accountability concerns.• No Meter System: The taxis do not have meters to regulate and transparently show fare costs.• Overcharging and Aggressive Behavior: These drivers overcharge customers, often in a coercive manner, particularly targeting tourists from out of state or abroad who may not be familiar with the local regulations or fare expectations.The presence of these unregulated taxis damages the city’s reputation and negatively impacts the experiences of visitors, which could deter future tourism. It also undermines legitimate taxi businesses that comply with the law.I kindly request that the city take prompt action to investigate and address these unlawful practices. Enforcing stricter regulations, imposing penalties, and conducting routine checks during large events will help protect the public and maintain Detroit’s image as a welcoming destination for visitors.Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to hearing about any steps taken to resolve these issues.",42.337801098779195,-83.0494595,1729702231000,,1730289236000,"https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/17760022",22880,"Traffic Complaints",0

Drivers regularly hit the curb while making the turn, leading to multiple incidents every day. Despite three warning signs placed several miles ahead of the U-turn, many drivers disregard these signals, resulting in preventable accidents.While writing this letter, I have already witnessed two more accidents. Just recently, one of these incidents involved a driver crashing into a house located on the opposite side of the U-turn, on Newbern Street, approximately 250 feet from the turn. The damage to the property was substantial, further emphasizing the need for immediate action.Additionally, when vehicles hit the curb, they often end up striking the fence at Top Gearz Auto Center or landing in a deep hole next to the curb. This not only causes the vehicle to lose control but also leads to dangerous accidents where cars cross the entire median, heading directly into oncoming traffic on the three-lane section of the Davison Freeway. This creates a highly hazardous situation for both drivers and pedestrians.Given the frequency of these accidents, the serious property damage, and the potential for more catastrophic incidents, I urge the city to take swift action.
